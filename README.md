# Calibration light scattering - carbon per cell
A set of independent experiments was conducted to compare independent measurements of carbon quotas with those estimated from Mie-predicted cell diameter. Carbon per cell was determined for 6 axenic cyanobacteria cultures (<i>Prochlorocococcus</i> MED4, MIT9312, AS9601 and NAT12A, <i>Synechococcus</i> 7803 and WH8012 ) and 4 different eukaryotic phytoplankton cultures (<i>Micromonas pusilla, Navicula transitans, Thalassosira pseudonana</i> 3367 and 1135) by using a CHN analyzer to measure total particulate organic carbon for samples collected on pre-combusted 0.3-µm GF-75 and 0.7-µm GF/F filters for cyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes, respectively. Carbon quotas were obtained by normalizing the concentrations of particulate organic carbon to cell abundance measured by a BD Influx cell sorter. Mie-predicted cell diameter using light scatter measurements from SeaFlow was converted to carbon quotas assuming spherical particle and a volume to carbon ratio of 220 fg µm<sup>-3</sup>, commonly applied to small size phytoplankton (Li et al. 1992, Ishizaka et al. 1994, Velduis et al. 1997, Veldhuis & Kraay 2004). 

For both of our SeaFlow isntrument (serial number 740 and 751), we found that carbon quotas were in good agreement with our light scatter-based estimates using an index of refraction of 1.38 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94, p < 0.0001). Note that our predictions of carbon quotas using a lower index of refraction (1.35) for the three smallest <i>Prochlorococcus</i> cultures were 35% lower than those measured by CHN analyzer, which suggest that not all <i>Prochlorococcus</i> cells were captured by 0.3 µm GF75 filters.

Cultures were grown under continuous light and monitored the cultures daily to ensure cells were growing exponentially at the start of the experiment. See [notebook.pdf](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/notebook.pdf) for more details.

We measured cell abundance using BD Influx cell sorter (see [influx-cultures.csv](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/influx-cultures.csv)) and total particulate organic carbon in triplicate using CHN analyzer (see [poc-data.csv](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/poc-data.csv)). Estimates of carbon cell quotas for each culture were calculated by normalizing POC by cell number, data file is available here: [Qc-cultures.csv](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/Qc-cultures.csv).

The entire analysis used to generate carbon cell quotas is available in [analysis_influx.R](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/analysis_influx.R). Raw CHN data are available in [UW_Exp_PCPN_DATA_FR.xlsx](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration/blob/master/UW_Exp_PCPN_DATA_FR.xlsx); raw FCM files (3.8 GB) can be downloaded using [Dat](https://github.com/datproject/dat). After installation, simply type in the terminal to start download data ```dat clone dat://cdfef982ea4032592e454c1a39b0a3855738b309d7e78ef8b2d0152adc5ffd02```

We still have a few extra FCM samples that we will be happy to share. Contact us if you are interested (ribalet@uw.edu)
