# fsc-poc-calibration
The goal of this experiment was to calibrate normalized light scattering measured by flow cytometers into cellular carbon content using phytoplankton cultures of various cell diameter. 
We used exponentially growing axenic cultures grown under continuous light and measured cell abundance and total particulate organic carbon in each culture. 
If you would like to calibrate your flow cytometer, we collected extra samples that we will be happy to share. Contact us if you are interested (ribalet@uw.edu)
