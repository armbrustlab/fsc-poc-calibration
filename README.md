# fsc-poc-calibration
The goal of this experiment was to calibrate light scattering measured by flow cytometers into cellular carbon content using phytoplankton cultures of various shapes and sizes. 
We used exponentially growing axenic cultures grown under continuous light and measured cell abundance and total particulate organic carbon in each culture. Results can be found in **Qc-cultures.csv**

If you would like to calibrate your flow cytometer, we fixed extra FCM samples that we will be happy to share. Contact us if you are interested (ribalet@uw.edu)
